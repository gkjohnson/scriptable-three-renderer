# scriptable-three-renderer

Investigating new options for making the WebGLRenderer more customize-able.

## Goal

Break out basic functions for setting and updating materials, geometry, render targets, rendering, frustum culling etc so the rendering process can be more easily optimized and extended for specific use cases. Provide an out of the box pipeline that behaves similar to THREE's built in one.
